# GW/Values

GW/Values is a library to wrap PHP's primitive values into cleaner and more user-friendly objects.

## Installation

It works only on PHP 7.1. This library is available on Composer/Packagist as `goworkpl/values`. To install it execute:
```
composer require goworkpl/values ^0.1
```

or manually update your `composer.json` with:
```
(...)
"require": {
    "goworkpl/values": "^0.1"
}
```

and run `composer install` or `composer update` afterwards. If you are not using Composer, download sources from GitHub and load them as required. However, using Composer is highly recommended.
